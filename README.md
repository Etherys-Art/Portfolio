# Configuration
Below you'll find explanations on how to properly customise your portfolio using the .txt files found in the `Config` folder. 

## User Information
To define who you are, where you work, your country and what you look like. It's pretty darn simple to do. Just open `userinformation.txt` in the Config folder which can be found here `Config/userinformation.txt` and you will be greeted with the following:

The order of the first 4 (avatar/name/role@company/location) need to remain the same for it to make sense. The social links below can be in whatever order you wish. I'd recommend sticking to 6 but you can have more if you please. There is support for 23 socials. Which are as follows:
- x/twitter
- facebook
- discord
- instagram
- youtube
- linkedin
- artstation
- github
- wordpress
- vimeo
- behance
- playstation
- xbox
- vk
- steam
- tumblr
- threads
- patreon
- twitch
- mixer
- mastodon
- mailchimp
- email

The user information is universal, so wherever there is userinformation like your about page and project pages, it'll appear there.
And that's it really. Pretty straight forward. Make sure to save the file once done editing.

## Your Summary
Your summary appears in your About page. It's just a summary of who you are and to change this simply open `summary.txt` that, like all configuration files, exists in the Config folder. `Config/summary.txt`. Just replace the Lorum Ipsum template text with your own and save. 

## Software
`Config/software.txt` holds all the software you use. I've included a bunch already as an example. They're separated by lines just so it's clear and simple to update. Make sure to save the file once done editing.

## Skills
`Config/skills.txt` like software holds all the skills you possess. I've included a bunch already as an example. They're separated by lines just so it's clear and simple to update. Make sure to save the file once done editing. 

## Recommendations
`Config/recommendations.txt` holds any and all recommendations you've received from your peers. It's somewhat familiar to your userinformation but has some extra structure/markdown to remember.

As you can see we have `---` acting as a separator from the other recommendations. It simply allows you to create multiple recommendations in one file, the `---` tells the code that there's a new recommendation below and should be considered a new one, if there's anything below it. Make sure to save the file once done editing.

## Productions
`Config/productions.txt` will hold all of the productions that you have worked on and want to display. Like with recommendations, each production should be separated with 3 dashes `---`.

Again, it's pretty straightforward. I've added a bunch of template so you can get the idea. Role, company, date (2020 - present or 2016 - 2023 for example), thumbnail url, description. 
Make sure to save the file once done editing.

## Defining Projects
This is really simple. When you create new Project folders, just copy the project folder name and populate the list. 
- Example Project
- BigMegaGunExample

The order here defines where the thumbnails on the landing page get populated. So, order how you want.
